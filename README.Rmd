`video2pic` is an R-package that allows you to extract still frames from a
video. For efficiency purposes, the frame-extraction-algorithm has been
implemented in python.

## Installation
Because the algorithm uses python in the background, you first need to install
**miniconda** on your system. Please follow the instructions
[here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to do so. Once you have
installed miniconda, you can install the development version of video2pic from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DavidDHofmann/video2pic")
```
Finally, you will also need to ensure that all necessary python packages are
installed. This can be done using the `video2pic_install()` function.

``` r
library(video2pic)
video2pic_install()
```

This will create a virtual python environment called "video2pic" containing the
required packages. You may need to **restart your R-session** after this!

## Example
The function to extract frames from a video is called `video2pic()`. The
function allows you to specify an output directory and the number of frames per
second that should be extracted. Note that you could also provide multiple
videos at once, so that you don't need to loop through multiple files.

```{r, echo = T, message = F, warning = F}
# Load required packages
library(video2pic)
library(magick)

# Initalize python environment
video2pic_initialize()

# Path to the example video
video <- system.file("extdata", "Earth.mp4", package = "video2pic")

# Extract one frame per second (and store them to a temporary directory)
video2pic(video, outdir = tempdir(), fps = 1)

# The extracted images can now be found here
imgs <- dir(tempdir(), pattern = ".JPG", full.names = T)

# We can visualize some of them if we want
image_read(sample(imgs, 4))

```
